# LeoTasks
A tasks manager app with a beautiful UI.

## Alert: Currently bugged!
Project was initially set up with IntelliJ's own build, but then I wanted it to go full Maven, and after making necessary changes, the code just stops at a point in AppClass.java.
Currently busy with other, newer projects, so can't look further into it. Would love it if someone pointed out the issue.

## Last Working Version
The last compiled, working version can be downloaded from my website https://mahditaz.pythonanywhere.com.
